  	<div class="body"> Recently, I went to Zurich for a work trip. Even though, I was there for only 4 days, I was able to visit the main sights of the city, taste the local cuisine, and enjoy the comfortable life of Switzerland. I hope this site makes you want to travel and discover this city! </p>
