	<div class="body"><p> If you're used to big cities, you will be surprised... Even though Zurich is one of the world's largest financial and economic centers, the city is quite small - at least when you compare it to cities such as New York, London or Paris! </p>
  	
  	
  	<p>Due to its small size, you can discover the city in only a couple of days! The major sights to see are all within walking distance of the Main Central Station: Zurich ZB.</p>
  	
  	<p>The sites I enjoyed the most are:
  	<ul>
  	<li>
  	    Zurich Old Town, on both sides of the Limmat river
  	</li>
  	<li> Walking down Bahnhofstrasse towards the Lake and window shopping</li>
  	<li> Fraumunster Church, with the artistic windows by Chagall </li>
  	</ul>
  	
  	<p>Besides the historic sites, definitely leave yourself some time to discover Swiss chocolate! My favorite is Spruengli. You can find many outlets in the city! In the train station alone, you'll find 2 stores! </p>
